## Drinks Reception & BBQ

The [UK’s Medical Image Analysis Network](https://median.ac.uk/) (MedIAN) invites all conference participants to join us for a Welcome Reception with Drinks and BBQ on Monday evening. Drinks will be served from 17:30 in the Queen’s Tower Rooms transitioning the Monday poster session into a social networking event. A selection of beer, wine and soft drinks will be served. The event will be a great opportunity to socialise and engage with our many industry sponsors, many of who are actively recruiting.

If weather permits, we will be opening the Queen’s Tower Rooms to have access to the Terrace next to the Queen’s Lawn where the outdoor BBQ will be served with a fine selection of meat and vegetarian burgers. In case of bad weather, food will be served inside Queen’s Tower Rooms. Please join us for this social event which is fully included in the conference registration.

## V&A Gala Dinner

The event most attendees look forward to, this year’s Gala will be held in the stunning Victoria and Albert museum. Built in 1852 this unique gem of Victorian architecture is home to 2.3
million objects that span over 5000 years of art.

The John Madejski Garden represents the centre of the V&A. It is one of the most elegant outdoor venues in London featuring a paved ellipse with water jets between steps. The perfect location to start this year’s London-style summer Gala with a refreshing drink accompanied by a variety of extraordinary food and lively Jazz music. The garden is one of London’s hidden treasures and is particularly magical when illuminated at night.

Later in the evening the party will continue inside the remarkable Dome. It is a stunning example of classical architecture with its soaring ceiling and marble floors. Enjoy a drink at the central bar that is overlooked by Dale Chihuly’s exceptional glass sculpture or unwind on the dance floor and get the party going. We are looking forward to welcoming you at the V&A to enjoy a unique night out in this iconic venue.

**Venue:** Victoria and Albert Museum, Cromwell Road, London, SW7 2RL (Exhibition Road Entrance)  
**Time:** Tuesday, July 9, 18:45 – 23:00
